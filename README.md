**Abstract:**
Light pollution has emerged as a significant issue in recent years, drawing attention
to its adverse impact not only on the environment but also on our daily lives.
It is crucial to implement measures to mitigate these negative effects by minimizing
light pollution in areas where it has experienced exponential growth. Currently,
there are no algorithms available that can determine light pollution from ground
images. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to classify night sky photos according
to the Bortle scale and subsequently utilize computer vision to identify discrete
constellation patterns while accounting for pollution noise. The proposed approach
achieved promising results, with 99% accuracy in light pollution classification and a
mAP50 score of 88.6% for constellation detection, considering the challenges posed
by sky-glow, missing stars, and variations in constellation shapes near the horizon.
These results open new horizons for addressing light pollution and provide motivation
for future research in this field.
